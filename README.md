## General Information
- This project is based on the supervised machine learning algorithm, multiple linear regression.
- The dataset that is being used here is of bike sharing dataset, contains info of the number of customers choosing to rent the bike under certain conditions.
- There are multiple factors that are present and affect the decision making of a customer to make a choice of renting a bike, like weather conditions , day of the week,etc.
- We are trying to generalize all the factors in form of a linear equation : y= mx+c , where we would be getting the values of the constants m and c using our model, and we can predict the value of y, if we just had a single value of x available with us.
- In general we need to predict:
    -  Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
    -  How well those variables describe the bike demands(predicting the value of their coefficients).

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 r2 score value of the training dataset is 0.8409825848994423
- Conclusion 2 r2 score value of the testing dataset is 0.8154215584129598
- Conclusion 3 r2 score of training and test dataset are almost similar so the model performs good.
